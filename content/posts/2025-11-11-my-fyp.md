# Building My Final Year Project

Shipping your first production project is a milestone. Here's what I learned from mine.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

For my final year project, I developed the **CS One Stop Portal** — a centralized web application designed for **Computer Science students and lecturers**. The goal was to create a single platform for sharing resources, managing announcements, organizing collaborations, and enhancing academic communication.

This project combined **modern web technologies** with practical university workflows, focusing on both **functionality** and **user experience**.

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

The system was built using a combination of modern technologies that ensured scalability, security, and maintainability:

- **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui** for a clean and responsive interface  
- **Backend:** **Node.js** using **tRPC** for type-safe APIs  
- **Database:** **PostgreSQL** (hosted on [Neon.tech](https://neon.tech/)) with **Prisma ORM**  
- **Authentication:** **Clerk Auth** for secure user management  
- **File Storage:** **Amazon S3** for resource and file sharing  
- **Hosting:** **Vercel** for the frontend and **Railway** for backend deployment  

---

## ⚙️ Core Modules

The system was divided into several core modules:

1. **User Management** – Handles registration, authentication, and role-based access (student, lecturer, admin).  
2. **File Sharing & Resources** – Allows uploading, updating, deleting, versioning, and sharing files or folders.  
3. **Announcements** – Lets lecturers and admins broadcast messages to selected groups or all users.  
4. **Collaboration & Discussion** – Enables students to form groups, chat, and assign tasks.  
5. **Dashboard** – Summarizes key information for each user role, such as recent uploads or announcements.

---

## 🧩 System Design

I started with a **System Requirement Design (SRD)** report outlining both **functional** and **non-functional** requirements — covering aspects like performance, scalability, and security.

The backend was designed using a **modular architecture**, with each feature represented as a separate router in tRPC.  
For the database schema, I followed **normalization principles** and enforced **referential integrity** using Prisma relationships.

Here’s a simplified structure:


---

## 🧪 Testing & Evaluation

I prepared a **Testing Report** that included **test cases** for each module, such as:

- Uploading and versioning files  
- Assigning user roles  
- Creating and viewing announcements  
- Group collaboration and messaging  

Each test case was validated using both **manual testing** and **API endpoint checks** via Postman.

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Start with a solid database schema** – It prevents most issues later in development.  
2. **tRPC is a game changer** – Type-safe APIs speed up debugging and ensure consistency between frontend and backend.  
3. **Clerk integration** was straightforward and saved a lot of time managing authentication flows.  
4. **UI/UX consistency** matters — Tailwind and shadcn/ui helped me maintain a professional look across pages.  
5. **Deploy early** — Testing your app in a production-like environment reveals hidden bugs you won’t find locally.

---

## 🚀 The Result

By the end of the semester, the portal became a **fully functional platform** where users could register, upload files, post announcements, and collaborate seamlessly.  
It not only met all the academic requirements but also served as a **real-world ready application** that could be scaled for departmental use.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

Building the CS One Stop Portal taught me the entire lifecycle of a software project — from **requirement analysis** to **deployment and testing**.  
It strengthened my skills in **full-stack development**, **system design**, and **project management**.

If you’re starting your final year project soon, my advice is simple: **plan early, build consistently, and test often**.  
The journey is tough, but the satisfaction of seeing your project live is worth every line of code.
